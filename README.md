# AACT-Sample-Graphs
Example graphs of interventional trials in ClinicalTrials.gov 2008-2016

I have summarized selected characteristics and time trends in interventional trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov between 2008-2016 using the database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT), available at http://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/.  

I accessed the live AACT database and generated graphical summaries of the trial portfolio using SAS v. 9.4 on a Linux operating system. SAS code and output is shared in this repository.
